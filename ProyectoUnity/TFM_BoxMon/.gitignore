# Modifications of the original .gitignore file provided in the Unity
# repository to fit our specific requirements
#
# Any new git ignore data to be not included in the file should be specified
# here to avoid it to be added to the repository
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Do not include third party libraries to save space in the repository
# the content of this folder comes from third parties and can be ignored
/Assets/ThirdParty

# Do not upload TextMeshPro to the repository. This content is downloaded
# directly for us by Unity and we should not put that data in the repo
/Assets/TextMesh Pro

# Do not upload ArtResources. This folder could use a lot of memory, so it
# should be shared by a Unity Package and not through the repository
Assets/ArtResources*
